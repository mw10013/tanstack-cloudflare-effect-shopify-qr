/**
 * Server-function auth middleware for Shopify embedded requests.
 *
 * No client phase:
 * - App Bridge patches global browser `fetch` and auto-attaches
 *   `Authorization: Bearer <session_token>` for embedded app requests.
 * - App Bridge also handles the retry contract for
 *   `401 + X-Shopify-Retry-Invalid-Session-Request: 1`.
 *
 * Server phase:
 * - verifies request/session with `shopify.authenticateAdmin(request)`
 * - injects `{ session }` into middleware context for handlers
 * - builds a session-scoped layer graph for server-function handlers:
  *   `CurrentShopifySession -> ShopifyAdmin -> ProductRepository`
 * - `runEffect` provides that composed layer in one shot, rather than chaining
 *   multiple `Effect.provide...` calls for each handler effect
 * - this keeps dependency wiring explicit and lets Effect construct the graph as
  *   layers: `ShopifyAdmin` needs `CurrentShopifySession`; `ProductRepository` needs
 *   `ShopifyAdmin`
 * - this is more efficient than repeated nested provides because the layer graph
 *   is built once per authenticated server-function request and then reused by
 *   each handler effect executed through `runEffect`
 *
 * Redirect nuance:
 * - `Shopify.authenticateAdmin` returns plain `Response.redirect(...)` values.
 * - TanStack router redirect control flow only recognizes redirects created by
 *   `redirect(...)` (redirect `Response` with router metadata).
 * - So redirect Responses are mapped to `redirect({ href })`; non-redirect
 *   Responses are failed through unchanged.
 *
 * Non-redirect `Response` values are re-thrown unchanged so status/headers
 * (for example Shopify's 401 retry contract) reach TanStack Start transport.
